        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is THE BEST lemon zucchini bread I've ever baked or tasted. The recipe came from a friend of my mom's. She kept raving about this bread that she had made while she was visiting. After I made it the first time I can understand why. If I don't put this in the freezer right away, it is gone!!! Butter is really good on this bread if you aren't worried about the calories, fat, etc.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>Â¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 cups grated zucchini</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans; sprinkle sugar into the bottom and on the sides of the greased pans.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Beat the eggs, 2 cups sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and lemon zest together in a large bowl.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Mix the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; add to the egg mixture and stir until the batter is thick. Fold the zucchini into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</p>
