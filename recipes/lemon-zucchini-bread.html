        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p class="description-message">This is THE BEST lemon zucchini bread I've ever baked or tasted. The recipe came from a friend of my mom's. She kept raving about this bread that she had made while she was visiting. After I made it the first time I can understand why. If I don't put this in the freezer right away, it is gone!!! Butter is really good on this bread if you aren't worried about the calories, fat, etc.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <div class="container">
            <ol class="list-item">
                <li class="normal">
                    Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans; sprinkle sugar into the bottom and on the sides of the greased pans.
                </li>
    
                <li class="normal">
                    Beat the eggs, 2 cups sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and lemon zest together in a large bowl.
                </li>
    
                <li class="normal">
                    Mix the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a separate bowl; add to the egg mixture and stir until the batter is thick. Fold the zucchini into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pans.
                </li>
    
                <li class="normal">
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.
